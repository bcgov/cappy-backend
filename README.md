# Cappy - The Application Catalogue

Cappy is a business-friendly application catalogue. It is currently built to provide a comprehensive catalogue 
of all software assets maintained on behalf of the Ministries of Children and Family Development, Social Development and Poverty Reduction,
and Education and Child Care.

It foregrounds key information in the following areas, focusing on how each application is:

  - Used in business
  - Supported and maintained (both internally and via vendors)
  - Financed and the total cost of ownership
  - Integrated within the ecosystem of other applications
  - Managed from a contractual and lifecycle perspective.

It is built on the Laravel PHP application framework and uses FilamentPHP for rapid development of the data management tools. It is consumed via simple
REST API end-point by the front-end application.

The front-end application is a separate repository - it uses Svelte and SvelteKit to provide responsive read-only application for business users.

It is managed and developed by Jeremy Vernon (jeremy.vernon@gov.bc.ca) within Connected Services British Columbia.
